# Substitution-Cipher-Letter-Frequency-Analysis

### Overview:
Developed the substitution cipher method of encrypting plaintext to ciphertext
and then decrypting the ciphertext back to readable text.
Letter frequency analysis is used to find the most common encrypted letters
used in a large body of text allowing an attacker to use this information to decrypt
the entire key.
